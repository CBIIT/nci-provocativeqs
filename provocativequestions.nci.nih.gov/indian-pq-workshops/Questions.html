          The reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer in many of the developed countries have been attributed to systematically organised population screening programmes using Pap smear and HPV DNA test  prevailing in those countries.A decline in the incidence of this cancer is currently observed in India also,particularly in the states of Delhi,Kerala etc.where there is no organised screening programmes. How this can be explained ?Is it a biological shift?

          Every year, more than 10,000 papers get published in medical journals boasting newer therapeutic targets in various pathways regulating disease pathogenesis especially cancer. As a clinician, the observation that very very few (sometimes none) actually reach the level where a therapeutic target is designed or devised. Where exactly is the missing link between clinical practice and basic science research?

          According to World Cancer Report from WHO, the incidence of cancer in India is increasing every year and is one of the leading causes of deaths. Among men the most common cancers are lung, oral, lip, throat and neck cancers whereas in women breast, cervix, and ovarian cancers are most common. However, these cancers are treatable and early diagnosis holds key in reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with these cancer. The Provocative Question therefore is “Can we devise a cost-effective population based cancer screening protocol and awareness creation mechanisms for the country where,  1) resources are limiting, 2) population size is huge, 3) people are oblivious and 4) social constraints are enormous. Also can we ensure a comprehensive palliative care plan for all terminally sick patients or patients with advanced stages of cancer?”

          PQ: What is the importance and relevance of RNA binding proteins in the progression of cancer? Can targeting RBPs open up new avenues in cancer therapeutics?
Background: 
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are a class of regulatory proteins that play integral roles in various post-transcriptional processes, including the splicing, RNA processing, localization, stability and translation of RNA. RBPs typically contain RNA-binding domains and they bind to specific RNA molecules to function. The human genome contains more than 400 annotated RBPs. Although most of these RBPs are still poorly characterized, it is known that the dysfunction of certain RBPs is associated with initiation and progression of different cancers, for example, HuR, QKI, IMP1, IMP2, IMP3 etc. These upregulated RBPs may lead to stability and better translation of a set of oncogenes. Hence, targeting deregulated RBPs might result in suppression of a number of molecules responsible for progression of the cancer.
Feasibility: 
RBPs bind to their target RNA molecules by recognizing specific RNA sequences and their structures. Recent advances in technologies, such as cross-linking immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) and photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced (PAR) CLIP has made it possible to identify the RNA targets and binding motifs on them at the level of sequence and structure. Hence, designing nucleic acid oligos mimicking the RNA motifs bound by particular RBPs can help in targeting them at functional level. These oligos will help in sequestering the overexpressed RBPs. However, regulating the kinetics of such drugs is very important to ensure levels of available RBPs to be maintained at normal levels.

Implications:
Drugs against RBPs will open up new possibilities of cancer therapeutics which might help in targeting a network of cancer-causing genes. KSS Lab@IISc

          Here is a real Provocative Question. Andrew von Eschenbach, the then Director of the NCI, issued a challenge to eliminate death from cancer by 2015. Has USA been successful in doing that? Or even close to doing that? Or was that simply a challenge to inspire researchers to come up with a Eureka moment? Should India start with a blank slate on cancer research or should India follow what NCI/NIH has done in intensifying cancer research for close to last 5 decades? Of course India needs to take inspiration from the right moves by the NCI/NIH to fund innovative individual PI-driven research but should India ask the questions differently and more importantly, should India not consider a different approach and not even try making cancer care inexpensive and affordable rather than going the USA way?

I understand that this is a generic question but an important one none-the-less. This needs to be asked before we dive into details on the scientific questions.

          Not all patients having a particular tumor respond to a given treatment modality similarly? In other words, while some respond, others do not.  Is it possible to identify them that who will respond or not in advance?
Background:
Since the last five decades in cancer biology, ample examples have proven that patients do not respond equally to the chemotherapeutic drugs available for a particular cancer type. For example, in case of glioblastoma, the available therapy comprising of surgical resection, chemotherapy (temozolomide)and radiotherapy provides a median survival of approximately sixteen months. However, there are cases where patients survive till nearly five years. Such differences arise due to inter-tumoral heterogeneity. Hence, it is of utmost importance to identify specific markers/signatures that can differentiate patients into 'responsive' and 'non-responsive' categories to a particular chemotherapy in advance. This will enable us to know from beforehand whether a patient will benefit from a chemotherapeutic regime, and if not, other chemotherapies can be sought out for that patient depending on such signatures.
Feasibility:
The availability of high throughput techniques like microarray, methylation array etc. enables us to look into the expression profiles, methylation status of genes and miRNA status in tumor tissues. Such high throughput studies between 'responsive' and 'non-responsive' patients can lead to the discovery of prognostic signatures for each type of cancer that will help us know whether a patient will respond to a treatment or not.
Implications:
If we can stratify patients into 'responsive' and 'non-responsive' categories prior to treatment, then we will be able to find suitable patients for a given treatment. Also, this strategy will prevent patients from getting unnecessary treatments.  Further, it provides an opportunity to study the biology and molecular mechanisms behind responsiveness and paves way to find a method to reverse the chemoresistance.  KSS Lab@IISc

Large amount of genomic data have been generated in the last decade or so for various cancers. This includes microarray, exome, whole-genome etc. Can we analyze these data to discover the signature of metastasis? Can we use these metastatic signatures to quantify prognosis?

Large amount of genomic data have been generated in last decade or so for various cancers. There are drugs and clinical trials data as well. Also, clinical data of patients are available in electronic medical record (EMR). Can we normalize and combine all these data to create a knowledge-base? Can we build an inferential expert system in AI (Artificial Intelligence) that will use this knowledge and reduce error at the point of care and take cancer-care to the patient through telemedicine?

          Question: Why is it difficult to kill cancer stem-like cells? Can we think of some novel approaches to target the cancer stem-like cells? Background: Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are a sub-population of cancer cells present within the tumor. They have the properties of differentiating and giving rise to new tumor bulk cells as well as self-renewal. They are quiescent/slow-proliferating in nature which could be the possible reason why both traditional chemotherapies and modern targeted therapies, which target proliferative nature of cancer cells, fail to destroy CSCs. Hence, a new approach should be undertaken to target these CSCs by specifically targeting genes/moleculesresponsible for keeping them quiescent. Feasibility: Several models suggest that driver mutations are present in CSCs, yet CSCs are quiescent/slow-proliferating. It is believed that specific molecules or cues, that are specifically regulated, maintain these CSCs in the quiescent stage. This could includecell cycle regulation, anti-apoptotic or autophagy-related pathways and the signals from tumor microenvironment etc. These pathways are likely to be regulated by epigenetic events as these signals should be reversed when the CSCs differentiate to generate bulk tumor cells. Hence, targeting these pathways might specifically eliminate CSCs. Implications: In addition to chemotherapy and targeted therapy, methods to target CSCs as described above might be the key to eradicating cancer. From KSS Lab@IISc.

          Why targeted therapy is not always successful?

Background: Targeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances that block the function of a specific molecule, which is essential for the cancer growth. The standard chemotherapy is not specific as it targets all proliferating cells. However, targeted therapy is developed against a molecule which plays a major role in cancer initiation and progression, popularly known as 'driver genes'.Mutations in the driver genes make the cancer cells dependent on them for their growth.  When targeted therapy is given along with the standard chemotherapy, there are better chances of regression of tumor. The targeted therapies designed against these driver genes although proven to be helpful, are not always successful. The reason appears to be due tointratumoral cancer heterogeneity, which is the result of presence of multiple driver gene mutations in a single tumor.  Therefore using a “multitargeted” therapy aiming all the driver genes in a given tumor would be a better approach, which will take care of the intratumoral cancer heterogeneity.
Feasibility:The requirement is, on a case to case basis, there should be deep sequencing of resected tumor or tumor biopsies, to identify all possible driver mutations for a given tumor.A comprehensive gene list of possible driver mutations in most cancers has been identified.  Based on this approach, one should be able to identify all the driver mutations present in a single tumor and develop a comprehensive therapeutic strategy.

          What is the importance of adequate sampling of tumors for targeted therapy?Is a small piece from a portion of a tumor, which is what normally given for molecular and pathological studies, adequate for next generation sequencing based driver mutation detection? In other words, will a small bit of a tumor represent the whole tumor or provide information about all driver mutations?
Background: Although a wide range of traditional therapies are available for different types of cancer, it has been difficult to achieve a cure for cancer, or even increase the longevity and quality of life of patients to a good extent for some cancers. This led to the advent of targeted therapy where patient-specific genetic alterations can be analyzed and depending on the genes altered, specific therapy can be given to individual patients. Next generation sequencing with deep coverage has paved the path to make targeted therapy more easy, cost effective and comprehensive. However, tumor sampling continues to be a limiting factor in case of solid tumors because of intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Hence, adequate sampling is required given that the portion resected out will represent only a sub region of the whole tumor and analyzing such a small portion for genetic alterations may not give the total list of driver alterations. 
Feasibility: Multiple portions of the same tumor can be biopsied and subjected to deep sequencing. Image guidance using neuro navigation techniques could be used to map the tumor boundary which could help us in collecting multiple biopsies that represent the whole tumor. Alternatively, fine needle aspiration (FNA) from multiple regions of the tumor can be carried out for random sampling of the whole tumor.
Implications: This can lead to a comprehensive idea about the total number of possible driver genetic alterations in the whole tumor even in the background of tumor heterogeneity. From KSS Lab@IISc

          Can generation of “Avatar” mice on a large scale, that is xenografts of human tumors in humanized mice, help establish a patient specific longitudinal model of tumor evolution? 

Background: The existence of sub-clonality leading to tumor heterogeneity has been amply demonstrated in the field of solid tumors including breast cancer. Therapeutic intervention culls the tumor cells initially; however, subsequently the same regimen is thought to result in the selection of resistant clones. Mutations in drug targets, alternate shunt pathways, compensatory mutations, existence of slow growing drug resistant stem cells are thought to be causes of resistance.  This path of tumor evolution to persistence may be dictated by multiple factors. Diet, age, geographical location, ethnicity, predisposing genetic factors, the initiating oncogenic event, stage at diagnosis, clonal heterogeneity, acquisition of newer driver/passenger mutations and the therapeutic regimen. 
Feasibility: Thoroughly clinically annotated tumors could be collected prospectively, a portion of the tumor frozen, a portion of tumor fixed for histology and a third portion could be divided into smaller random units and used to established xenografts to develop lines and sub-lines. Simultaneously, corresponding blood and urine samples at diagnosis, treatment, and all follow-ups could be placed in a bio-repository for future use. The frozen tumors could be typed for genetic aberrations at diagnosis by next generation sequencing platforms. Once established, the xenograft lines could be assessed by re-sequencing for common cancer mutations, by sorting for known cell-types over time, establishing sub-lines by cloning, and post treatment of mice with established or experimental therapeutics.   Analysis of such longitudinal sampling by several technologies could help catalogue as many events in tumor evolution as possible. Mathematical modeling of this comprehensive data could help generate predictive algorithms to guide therapy. 

Implications: Such studies may help answer basic questions about the molecular if not the etiological course of tumor evolution. The therapeutic regimen could be altered experimentally in mice to determine those that offer maximum clinical benefit. Modeling of such data may help predict clonal selection post therapy and thus impact clinical decisions.

          How do you rank CNV/structural variation (SV) of a chromosomal region over somatic mutation in driver genes in a particular cancer for causality? Whether somatic mutation in a driver gene precedes SV in the time course of tumor progression? How could we do joint analysis of SV’s and somatic mutations to find out the most significantly mutated gene/region after correcting for length of the gene/genomic region and recurrence in patients? Also there is a need for development of more tools for integrative pathway analysis by joint analysis of somatic SNVs and SVs.

          How can circulating cell free tumour DNA and RNA be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of patients of gingivobuccal oral cancer?

Efficient management of cancer patients depends upon early diagnosis and effective monitoring during therapy. However, development of biomarkers has been very challenging in cancer, especially those which can be used in biospecimens collected by ono-invasive means. With recent explosion of our knowledge of cancer driver genes and driver somatic mutations in various types of cancer, primarily due to the initiatives of ICGC and TCGA, the prospect of development of effective genomic and epigenomic biomarkers in cancer has become possible. Recent evidences, although at preliminary levels, indicate that cell free circulating tumour DNA and RNA hold much promise. Their biggest advantage in solid tumours is that they can be detected in plasma i.e. liquid biopsies, thus eliminating the requirement of invasive surgical biopsies of tumour tissue. Hence, circulating cell free tumour DNA and RNA should be explored for their use as non-invasive biomarkers of early diagnosis and monitoring of patients of solid cancer like gingivobuccal oral cancer, which is a major cancer type prevalent in India.

          What are the genomic drivers of metabolic reprogramming in gingivobuccal oral cancer?

Rapid cellular proliferation is a key feature of all cancer types and it imposes aberrantly high energy demand caused by vital cellular processes. Cancer cells have been found to avidly utilize glucose and generate lactate. This phenomenon is known as Warburg Effect or aerobic glycolysis and is now considered to be a major metabolic hallmark of cancer cells. Since this “molecular sweet tooth” of cancer cells confers them with selective advantage, they are attractive actionable targets for treatment. The genomic triggers of this metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells are not clearly defined till date. Gingivobuccal oral cancer is the most common type of cancer in men and fourth most common in women in this subcontinent. Recent work from our group in the ICGC project had identified somatic alterations and driver genes in gingivobuccal oral cancer patients from India. A comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial and the exome sequence data of the patients is expected to provide extremely valuable information on the identity of the genomic drivers of the bioenergetics shift towards Warburg Effect specifically in oral cancer. Given that cancer is now recognized as a genomic disease and various cancer types are expected to have common mechanisms of tumerigenesis, these findings can be of relevance across other cancer types.

          Now we are aware about intratumoral genomic heterogeneity and its clonal nature within the tumor. These mutations may have distinct downstream functions based on its intra-genomic interactions. Therefore, in order to directly correlate genomic makeup of cells with its functions within the tumor, I am curious if we can devise methods to monitor in vivo functional heterogeneity among tumor cells.

          What is the spectrum of familial cancer syndromes in India? Are genes identified in the West (BRCA1/2 in breast, MLH1/MSH2/PMS2/MSH6 in HNPCC/lynch, APC in FAP) also the major genes in Indian families? Is there collated data available of various cancer families with more than one affected member which can be studied for identification of novel cancer genes? There is scattered data from India which highlights familial associations not reported from other populations. There is obvious clinical benefit through prevention if important genes/mutations predisposing to familial cancer syndromes can be identified in the Indian population.

          PQ-Why does neo adjuvant chemotherapy not improve survival?

Background- Neo adjuvant chemotherapy is used in many solid tumours. However even though it produces tumour responses there is no improvement in overall or disease free survival compared to adjuvant chemotherapy in operable tumours eg NSABP B27 in breast cancer, EORTC and CHORUS trial in ovarian cancer where even though optimal cytoreduction rates doubled but there was no improvement in survival. Those achieving pathological complete response or optimal cytoreduction do better than those who do not. What we do not know is whether the survival of those who do not achieve pathological complete response is inferior to those who undergo upfront surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Possible hypothesis being selection of chemoresistant clones, genomic instability or immune incompetence after chemotherapy.

Feasibility-If the trial groups could look into their own data sets and find out and compare the disease free  and overall survival of those undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy, neo adjuvant chemotherapy achieving complete pathological response/ optimal cytoreduction and neoadjuvant chemotherapy not achieving pathological complete response/ optimal cytoreduction (after adjusting for surgical mortality). This being a post hoc analysis would be at least hypothesis generating.Further molecular testing may be done on the archived histopathological samples pre and post chemotherapy to look whether there is any increase in chemoresistant clones or genomic instability or immune incompetence.

Clinical Implication- Presently neo adjuvant chemotherapy is used for both early and locally advanced tumours. If the survival of those not achieving complete pathological is worse than those undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy then should we be giving neoadjuvant chemotherapy in all operable solid tumors especialy when surgery may be done without excess morbidity or mortality while preserving organ function.

          Tobacco, betel quid and alcohol are the main risk factors for oral cavity cancer (OCC) but certain dietary patterns and habits play a significant role in carcinogenesis. As OCC initiation and progression is primarily due to the oxidative damage to epithelial structures, micro-nutrients largely act by anti-oxidant properties. 
What are the components and patterns of Indian diet that contribute to changes in oral cancer and oral pre-cancer risk? How do they interact with established risk factors tobacco, alcohol and betel quid? How does 'life-course' dietary patterns contribute to this?

What leads to the accumulation of the specific Tregs? 

Can their accumulation be attributed to the following (which need to be investigated):  
i) due to proliferation of pre-existing Tregs in the tumor microenvironment?
ii) the recruitment of Tregs from periphery?
iii) the de novo conversion of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ lymphocytes into iTregs?

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a cell population that is involved in maintenance of immune tolerance. Their increased numbers infiltrating the tumor or peripheral blood have been depicted by several groups where it was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. These regulatory cells with transcription factor Fox p3 can either be naturally present (nTregs) or induced (iTregs) and have originated from thymus.

          Immunological reprogramming in colon cancer ?
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are involved in maintenance of immune tolerance. Their increased numbers infiltrating the tumor have been found to be associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. 

How does the adaptive immune response function around the tumor? 
Is there an immunological reprogramming which changes the scenario at the tumor niche? If so, then what factors are responsible and which are the major players of this program? What is the functional status of Tregs in tumor as well as the surrounding normal tissue?

          Gemcitabine is a widely used drug for pancreatic cancer therapy, but due to poor prognosis this drug is now in question. Cells resistance to gemcitabine activates EMT in the background, but the drug itself is a potential replication blocker and activates apoptosis, then why gemcitabine induced apoptosis activates a kind of fleeting mechanism (EMT) to get protection from apoptotic threat?

          Immunotherapy is a new way to treat cancer  that involves the innate immune system to fight cancer. What should be the basis of selecting the target candidate molecule for such a therapy? We are are aware of the fact that there are  differences between gene expression in normal and cancerous tissue, however the molecule specific to cancer cells have evolved a way to evade the immune system. How one should approach such a problem with heterogeneous expression of various gene products?

          There are tumors that appear cancerous in biopsy specimens but are not malignant in behavior or aggressive in nature. Especially in prostate cancer such observation are recorded. How does one go about to find out such phenotype misleading diagnosis? In fact such diagnosis results in undue aggressive cancer treatment which has lot of side effects to the patients.  This will certainly save some people from the problems related to treatment and improve their quality of life.

          What common genetic features characterize patients diagnosed with malignancies (solid tumors) at an early age (<45 yrs)?
Background: Cancer is a disease of old age. However it is well documented that in India and other developing nations, a significantly larger number of men and women below the age of 45 years are diagnosed with cancers. This is attributed primarily to the burden of infection. However, given that the burden of infection is common to the population at large, host genetic factors must be significantly contributing to emergence of the disease in these subjects. 
Feasibility: Focus on solid tumors will enable coverage of majority cases involving common cancers as well as provide a common ground from a point of view of mechanistic overlap in view of epithelial origin of these malignancies. Multi-centric, large-scale genotyping studies could be carried out in carefully categorized patient groups and appropriately matched population based controls, to identify types and frequencies of genetic variants associated with various known or major pathways, linked to susceptibility to malignant disorders.
Implications of success: Understanding of common / predominant variants  amongst the early onset cases could be informative in the context of, i) genetic and ethnic diversity in the populations ii) relative contribution of individual pathways to risk and development of malignancy in general population (sporadic cases), iii) clues for risk stratification amongst high risk groups as well as identification of high risk individuals in general population iv) probable gene-nutrition interactions in analyses based on socio-economic stratification,  & finally, v) probable directions for cancer prevention strategies in high-risk subjects.

          The ecosystem of a cancer is continuously evolving landscape since its inception in the body where multiple physiological factors' conglomerate act as a nonchalant driving force during tumor growth. The origin of Cancer Stem Cell model supports cancer initiation and relapse, however, in the context of regular tumor maintenance it is non archaic, rather. If CSCs originate and EXPAND a tumor then  1) are they also responsible for Intratumoral heterogenity?, where every cell is unique for its transcriptional/epigenetic/genetic landscape or is it a result of physiological selection pressure operational on individual cells during tumor evolution? 2)Shall we extend our knowledge of CSCs beyond their self renewal/tumor initiation abilities and look for newer horizons to functionally classify CSCs (e.g. in vitro/ in vivo understanding of CSCs derived differentiated progeny v/s bulk tumor cells ability to acquire diverse genetic phenotypes under tumor stress conditions). In short, do we need a non-self renewal based approach to functionally validate CSC model for having a deeper insight into tumor architecture and to design CSC based personalized therapy?

          PQ: Novel approaches to understand cancer stem cell metabolism for therapy.		
Background: Present available cancer treatment methods have been improved and longevity of human life span has increased with different anti cancer drugs. But, complete cure was not assured. Overwhelming evidences supports that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in initiation and maintenance of a tumour in addition to their capability to dictate invasion, metastasis, heterogeneity and multi-drug resistance (MDR) upon prolong usage of drugs. To study exactly what’s happening to these CSCs at the time of treatment is very important aspect. Hence, there is an urgent need to use novel approaches and strategies to control or eradicate of CSCs.
Feasibility: Identification and isolation of these CSCs using putative surface (CD) marker by flowcytometer or magnetic bead cell separation methods. 
Implication of success: Isolation and understanding the morphological behaviour along with conversion capacity of CSCs to cancer cells is key answers of the disease.

          Cancer heterogeneity is a well known fact and has been well demonstrated by recent NGS techniques. With different parts of the same tumor having different mutations including potential therapeutic targets, proper sampling of tissues is necessary. The conventional biopsy sampling and analysis for the development of personalized therapeutics is likely to be at a disadvantage. What would constitute an “adequate sampling” for a biopsy? Can mathematical models be applied to predict potential heterogeneity in mutations based on one sampled biopsy specimen? Would it then help to choose the most appropriate therapy?

          Organ specific chemotherapeutic toxicity can be variable in different individuals. Some may develop mild toxicity while others can develop life threatening toxicity. What contributes to individual specific variation in toxicity? While some SNPs in the drug metabolizing enzymes have been associated with the development of toxicity with some drugs [6-mercaptopurine, irinotecan], in most circumstances there is no definitive information. Can we identify the factors contributing to the profound organ toxicity in some individuals, so that better dose adjustments or alternate drugs could be used?

          Can some rhabdomyosarcomas be made to differentiate into benign rhabdomyomas? Will  recognising skeletal muscle growth factors & receptors help (akin to neurotrophin receptors & ligands like TrkA causing maturation of neuroblasts) ?

          This question is epidemiologic but prevention is better than cure. Since both ovarian low and high grade serous carcinomas  originate from the distal fallopian tube, wouldn’t  (large- scale) snipping of the fimbrial end of both tubes at the time of tubectomy (with informed consent) prevent the majority of serous carcinomas developing over time? Since there is increased incidence of ovarian carcinoma as the socio-economic status of a population improves, this would make sense in a low-resource developing country like India where tubectomy is a commonly practiced family planning procedure.

          Can we harness the potential of extracellular vesicles to assess cancer risk?

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released continuously into extracellular space by healthy and disease cells, and they carry molecular signatures and effectors of health and disease. EVs (exosomes, oncosomes, microvesicles and apoptotic bodies) reflect changes taking place in tissue microenvironment in health and different stages of a disease.  Trafficking and reciprocal exchange of molecular information by EVs among different organs and cell types have been shown to contribute to horizontal cellular transformation, cellular reprogramming, functional alterations and metastasis. The EVs cargo may have tumor suppressors, phosphoproteins, proteases, growth factors, bioactive lipids, mutant oncoproteins, oncogenic transcripts, microRNA and other nucleic acid sequences. Therefore, the EVs present in biofluids offer an unprecedented, remote, and non-invasive access to crucial molecular information about the health status of cells, including their driver mutations, classifiers, risk of developing a disease, molecular subtypes, therapeutic targets, and molecular markers of drug resistance.  In addition, the EVs may offer a non-invasive way to assess the cancer initiation, tumor promotion, progression, risk, survival and treatment response.

In large prospective cohort studies it is challenging, and in some cases impossible, to collect repeat biospecimens from healthy individuals prior to they develop a disease, and repeat invasive biospecimen collection in healthy or clinically asymptomatic individuals is not justified.  EVs in body fluids, including blood, present a unique opportunity where a possibility exists to obtain serial samples of EVs of varying origin by a non-invasive or minimally invasive procedure throughout the life course for temporal evaluation, and perhaps they may offer a glimpse into cancer development. This opportunity may transform the way molecular epidemiology is conducted in cancer in the near future.

          Question ID: WS-66 
Submitted by: Anil Wali
February 25, 2011


How can we integrate best practices of eastern traditional medicine, incidence, prevalance and mortality rates seen among global populations with our current standard of care in cancer continuum. Background:There are many instances where prevalance of certain cancers are quite low in East Asian countries due to their dietary intake of spices and supplements that have anti-inflammatory properties. Prostate cancer would be nice example. The prologed use of these dietary practices from early childhood to adult life seem to have profound effect on the well being of majority of the population. It has been well documented fact that migration of these populations to US and acculturation with new dietary practices somehow increase their risk of developing malignancies. It could be partially due to the influence of gene environment interactions, stress and several other biological and non-biological factors. Feasibility:How could this complex problem with complicated disease etiology and pathogenesis be addressed in a simple pragmmatic way. We have made phenominal advances in the field of early detection, stem cells, imaging, targeted therapies based on pharmacogenomics but only incremental advances in prevention of the cancer for last 40 years. Addressing risk behaviors and excercise alone are not enough for "At-Risk" and "High-Risk" populations who are susceptible for developing cancer over their life time. Implications of Success:A global initiative led by NCI that would initiate partnerships with Insitutions of Excellence in Eastern Asain countries that have accumulated myriad of published data and clinical best practices in various types of malignancies. It would be a worthwhile effort to initiate scientific dialogue among scientists from these countries to foster synergy among trans-disciplinary approaches practiced here in USA to combat dreaded insiduous disease like cancer.

          One of the main tenets of Ayurveda-the ancient natural health care system of India – 

“is that proper diet and digestion are one of the major pillars of life and an improper diet or inadequate digestive capacity is the root cause of all disease processes. Compromised mucosal integrity and disturbances in bacterial flora give rise to ‘leaky gut syndrome’ and ‘dysbiosis’, which thereby permits the absorption of incompletely digested material (intermediate metabolites) resulting  in a host of problems locally in the gastrointestinal tract as well as generalized in the organ systems. There is evidence linking increased intestinal permeability with immune dysfunction, systemic disease, and multi-organ system failure. Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT) forms about 70% of the body’s immune system.” (Sharma H, AYU 2009;30: 88-105). 

Recent modern research has lent support to the Ayurvedic concept: there is interdependence of diet, immune and microbiota, and crosstalk between these elements dictates intestinal mucosal homeostasis as well as metabolic wellbeing. Accordingly, different species of gut flora are capable of driving the generation of different T cell subsets: while Bacteroides fragilis induces the formation of anti inflammatory - regulatory T cells (Tregs), Prevotella melaninogenica generates pro-inflammatory - Th17 cells. Shouldn’t an attempt therefore be made to thoroughly validate the Ayurvedic concept of pathophysiology of cancer using modern molecular tools? This would be a major step in making Ayurvedic Medicine evidence based and thus would be more acceptable for prevention (and maybe treatment) of diseases.

          By the age of 5 years, ~95% of children in India are exposed to primary Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection. Pediatric Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) is the fourth most common malignancy in children; 20 to 30% of cases occur before 5 years of age and is uniformly (~100%) associated with EBV. What predisposes some of the infected children to develop HL? 
Majority of these children belong to a low socioeconomic group where malnourishment is common. Diet has recently been found to influence the microbiome in the infant gut which in turn has been shown to regulate the generation of immune cells, notably the Th17 subset. Likewise worm infestation, which is common in India, has been shown to skew the immune response towards Th2 type. In fact, studies have also demonstrated reactivation of latent viruses due to worm infestation. To what extent do nutrition (including micronutrients), microbiome, and worm infestation regulate protective immune responses particularly in childhood malignancies?

          Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) often combined with surgery is the main therapeutic strategy for the management of locally advanced prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer. Moreover, ADT is known to provide remission of the disease in almost 90% of the patients. However, inspite of continuous hormonal therapy, the disease progresses after a mean time of 2-3 years in all the patients eventually leading to a more aggressive phenotype which is known as castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Metastatic CRCP is often associated with poor prognosis and mean survival of only 16-18 months. Till date there is no medical cure available to treat metastatic CRPC that can provide progression-free survival which makes this disease as one of the major health burdens globally. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the largely unknown molecular mechanism underlying metastatic CRPC which itself originates from hormone sensitive cancer cells. As of now, no such biomarker or signature molecule is known that can be used to diagnose and/or prognose metastatic CRPC in the patients. This study may enable us to identify some signature molecules associated with metastatic CRPC that can be employed clinically to diagnose the disease. And also, better therapeutic strategies can be designed to manage metastatic CRPC effectively.

          The chicken and egg problem in cancer: Whether tumour formation creates microenvironment or an erratic environment creates  a group of transformed cells into tumour by fooling the immune system, initiating angiogenesis etc.? 
Background: It is now known that tumour microenvironment plays a significant role in tumour progression, metastasis and prognosis. However not much is known about the early cross talks between a transformed cell and its surroundings, e.g.  the molecular and signalling events and secretory molecules  from cancer cells that change the environment.
Implications for public health: Knowing this better will definitely help us in  quick diagnosis, control and treatment.

          PQ. No. 1: What factors determine the EMT initiation in selective cells in primary tumor and support their survival in blood stream and what causes their dormancy, self-renewal and proliferation at secondary site in breast cancer?

PQ. No. 2: Can we study the physical changes of tumor cells during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) at primary site of breast tumor and track their pre-metastatic movement during intravasation and extravasation by optical imaging?

PQ. No. 3: Can we develop an appropriate genetically modified (transgenic) mice model by depleting the stromal cells such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) or tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and to study their roles in breast cancer progression?

          Rapid industrialization and changing lifestyle appears to be significantly altering the profile of cancer incidence in India. On the one hand, breast cancer is poised to overtake (or perhaps has already overtaken) cervical cancer as the most common cancer among women. On the other hand, colorectal cancer (CRC) has toppled cancers of the esophagus and stomach as the most prevalent gastrointestinal tract cancer. This calls for drastic changes in public health policies for cancer prevention. Equally important is to improve our understanding of these cancers. Aging related colon cancer is a well-studied and most common CRC subtype in the West but is comparatively rare in India. Whereas, early-onset sporadic rectal cancer (EOSRC) is the most prominent CRC subtype in India but accounts for less than 10% of all CRC cases in the west. Moreover our knowledge of molecular origins of EOSRC is meagre. What are the key genetic events that drive EOSRC? What deregulated pathways drive tumor initiation and progression in this CRC subtype (given the absence of canonical pathways that drive late-onset colon cancer).

          Often we discuss presence of unique tumor subtypes among Indian cancer patients. For example a) Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) appears to be prominent among Indian women unlike the West; b) aging related colon cancer is the most prominent colorectal cancer subtype in the West whereas early-onset sporadic rectal cancer is the predominant subtype in India; c) Periampullary carcinoma is the prominent pancreatic cancer subtype in India unlike the West where pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) predominates. What can be the reason(s) for a unique cancer profile in India? Is it a result of unique haplotypes/polymorphisms in Indians or is it due to unique environmental factors? Or could it be a combination of both (nature + nurture)?

          Existing intervention clinical trials are now emerging as more and more expensive, labor-intensive and demand an exhaustive infrastructure. Thus these trials have become very difficult to execute especially in low resource settings. In view of this fact, how relevant it is to apply (similar) norms that govern clinical testing of new investigational drugs to re-purposing the existing drugs or active ingredients of traditional therapeutics extensively used in Ayurveda, Siddha and Homeopathy that already have defined safety and efficacy? Should not there be a less-stringent or separate policy/clinical trial strategy for testing of these potential leads?

          Urine collection is a non-invasive process and can be collected frequently from patients in large amount.  We  can find healthy volunteers also easily.  Looking at the advancement in mass spectrometry techniques, should we focus on urinary proteomics/metabolomics to find early detection cancer biomarkers?

          Every month several publications are appearing in journals related to sequencing of cancer genome using next generation sequencing strategies. Several mutations are reporting in these articles. My question how we can conclude which of these mutations are of critical in nature for cancer initiation and progression and maintaining its oncogenic nature?

          If we accept the Cancer Stem Cell hypothesis which postulates that only a specific sub-population of cells within a solid tumor drives tumor growth, then, what specific features could be attributed to this cancer stem cell  population that make them differ from normal stem cells and stromal cells residing within the tumor. Can any functional criteria besides molecular markers be attributed to cancer stem cells within a solid tumor?

          Tumor microenvironment regulates the induction of self-renewal property in surviving cancer cells after chemotherapy. What are the model systems we have to address the role of microenvironment in regulating the induction of self-renewing cancer stem cells?
Background
Recurrence after chemotherapy or radiotherapy is a major reason for poor treatment outcome.  It is believed that cancer cells possessing self-renewal ability or cancer stem cells have chemoresistance and they escape treatment, and eventually reconstitute the tumor.  But recent reports suggest that all cells escaping treatment are not self-renewing cells, but altered microenvironment, mainly the tumor stroma convert them to self-renewing cells leading to recurrence. Tumor microenvironment constituted by cancer cells, stromal cells and vasculature cells is reported to play a major role in maintaining hypoxia, a key regulator of induction of self-renewal ability. Some of the pathways initiated by tumor microenvironment might be critical in this induction. It is reported that in drosophila ovary, the stemness of the germinal stem cells is maintained by the balance of Notch and TGF-β signaling, and which component of the niche is the sending cell and receiving cell of the signal is critical in the decision to undergo self-renewal or differentiation. So it is necessary to have a model system to evaluate which component of the tumor microenvironment is involved in the regulation of induction of self-renewal ability
Feasibility
It is possible to create model systems including cancer cells stromal cells and endothelial cells using co-culture systems on 3D scaffolds, and in vivo xenograft and/or  orthotopic mouse models  with immunocompromised mouse. We might have to label each component with appropriate tags to trace each component.
Implications of success
Understanding the pathways initiated by tumor microenvironment will help us to design inhibitors to block the induction of self-renewing cells that lead to recurrence.

          Oral cancer in young (<45 years) patients – Is a new entity?

Usually, oral cancer is a disease mainly affecting the older age group.  This has generally been attributed to indiscriminate substance abuse, particularly the use of smokeless tobacco and related products, over a considerable period of time. Recent epidemiological data on oral cancer shows, there is an increase in the incidence rate of oral cancer, especially in tongue, in young adults (<45 Years) and most of them does not have any oral habits. Also the current data revealed that there is a significant difference in the survival pattern of young patients having carcinoma of Tongue. The reasons for this are largely uncertain and the explanations offered are mostly speculative. The changes in risk factor and age dependence with the incidence and prognosis of oral cancer implied a possibility of change in the pathway/s of carcinogenesis. Thus, it arises following pertinent queries to know further and manage the disease properly.  Is it a new entity? What will be the epidemiological and genetic etiological factors for this group? Is, the carcinogenetic pathway for this entity is different from the usual form of oral cancers?
